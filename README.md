# Banking-Management-System
The Bank Management System is a SQL-based database project designed to manage customer accounts and financial transactions in a simplified banking environment. This project demonstrates the use of MySQL Database Concepts such as table creation, primary and foreign keys, constraints, joins, aggregate functions, stored procedures, and views.

# Purpose of the Project

The purpose of this project is to create a structured and efficient database system that can handle the essential operations of a banking environment. It aims to simplify the management of customer accounts and financial transactions by storing data securely, ensuring accuracy through constraints and triggers, and enabling easy retrieval of information using SQL queries.

This project serves as a practical demonstration of database concepts such as relational design, normalization, data integrity, automation, and reporting. It helps users, learners, and developers understand how real-world banking systems manage data behind the scenes while providing a strong foundation in SQL-based database development.
